### What I learned

I learned that making a login from scratch for a single page application (SPA) is not a quick easy endeavor. I also learned just how difficult it can be to CSS google maps correctly. 


```css
.google_maps {
    width: 45%;
    height: 45%;
    color: black;
    overflow: hidden;
    margin-top: -15%;
    padding: 1%;
}
```
```js
    const Login = ({ setLoggedIn }) => {
        const [email, setEmail] = useState("");
        const [password, setPassword] = useState("");
        const [errorMessage, setErrorMessage] = useState("");

        const login = (event) => {
            event.preventDefault();
            axios
                .post(
                    "http://localhost:8000/api/login",
                    { email, password },
                    {
                        withCredentials: true,
                    }
                )
                .then((res) => {
                    console.log(res);
                    setLoggedIn();
                    navigate("/users");
                })
                .catch((err) => {
                    console.log(err);
                    setErrorMessage(err.response.data.msg);
                });
        };
```

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This has always been one of my go to's for any project that I have a minor question on.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - Stack overflow is an amazing resource where most of the questions that you could possibly have, have already been answered.
- [MDN Web Docs] (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - Mozilla is one of the most well written and easiest to digest sources of documentation available. I highly Recommend.
